## Inspiration
. There are lots of people who want to contribute some money to environmental social groups but because of fraud, they can't to spend that money. 
‚Ä¢ They also don‚Äôt where is there money how they use their money. How to see where is our money!!! Also don‚Äôt who is right group to give their money they are so confused. Then is there is any fraud what to do?
‚Ä¢Also social workers don‚Äôt know how to get money for their work. Because of lack of fundings, they arent able to do much things.


## What it does
In EnvNet web Platform , we have 2 different login features
for Sponsors and Social workers. They can first login and access different options.
Here sponsors can give allocate money any social environment group and can see social worker's ir blogs and works.
Sponsors can track where their money is being used .
After every work you can sponsor can approve social 
worker's payment.
Workers can claim money after their work complete


## How we built it
*We have chosen the MERN stack for building this, we divided the work for frontend and backend, We implemented first the UI ie frontend, Login, Logout and Signup, and the most important things was to make backend functionality were the tags of a particular user profile was stored and whenever a user would search they would get the profile under same tags.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
*We are proud that we had collaborated well, each and everyone actively participated and did their work at their level best. We completed the designing part with Figma early and started with coding the frontend and we have accomplished our idea as planned.


## What we learned
*We learned many things from collaboration on this project as well as from very informative workshops that would definitely help in the future. how to integrate front-end and backend while each of us was working on different sections. We learned to put up our ideas into implementation as reality.
